<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p>
  I like Purescript and Haskell and live in Helsinki. If you like either of these things too, then please reach out! (especially if you are in Helsinki)

<p>
  I would like for Helsinki to have a Code & Coffee and/or a Purescript meetup. Please contact me if you have any interest in providing space and co-hosting.
</p>

<p>
  For those wondering what the hell Code & Coffee meetups are:
  <ul>
    <li>
      They usually involve meeting every 2nd or 3rd Saturday from roughly 9 or 10AM to 1PM, give or take an hour or two.
    </li>
    <li>
      The organizers usually have everyone come in a circle to say their name and what project they will be working on (e.g. learning Haskell).
    </li>
    <li>
      Any sponsor ads (e.g. who brought donuts) are given here with a few ads about people who are hiring or looking for work.
    </li>
    <li>
      The rest of the meetup is largely done alone or in small groups that might center around a project.
    </li>
  </ul>
