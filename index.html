<p>I'm an American living in Helsinki, Finland. I am generally known for using PureScript, Nix, and Haskell.</p>

<p>I write blog posts on Qiita: <a href="https://qiita.com/kimagure">qiita.com/kimagure</a>. These are generally about PureScript or Nix, but sometimes about Haskell and other technologies.</p>

<p>I would like for Helsinki to have a Code &amp; Coffee meetup. Please contact me if you have any interest in providing space and co-hosting.</p>
<p>A Code and Coffee meetup is...</p>
<ul>
<li>A 9/10 - 12/1PM meetup meeting every 2/3 weeks on Saturday morning.</li>
<li>The organizers will gather people for the first ten minutes to present themselves and what they will work on that day.</li>
<li>Any company representatives will advertise their job openings.</li>
<li>The rest of the session is free form, with mostly smaller groups working on something.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have previously attended the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/NoVA-Code-Coffee/">NoVA Code &amp; Coffee</a> meetup. I hope you'll consider hosting one in Helsinki or your own city.</p>

<p>I was invited to speak about PureScript at the Front-End x Design Conference in Taipei, Taiwan: <a href="https://2018.fedc.tw/" class="uri">2018.fedc.tw/</a>.</p>
<p>I spoke about PureScript features that make it unique and some of the ways people might readdress ways they think about modeling problems.</p>
<p>I have recorded a video where I go over my slides from the conference: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaQo_kGY-Lc" class="uri">youtube.com/watch?v=iaQo_kGY-Lc</a></p>

<p>I was a guest in April 2018 for the podcast CoRecursive with Adam Bell: <a href="https://corecursive.com/010-purescript-and-avocados-with-justin-woo" class="uri">corecursive.com/010-purescript-and-avocados-with-justin-woo</a>.</p>
<p>In the episode, I talk about things that are good about PureScript, some of the things I believe about writing programs, about avocadoes and kabocha, and about the importance of culture in programming language communities.</p>
<h3 id="sep-2017">1 Sep 2017</h3>
<p>I was a speaker at Small FP Conf: <a href="https://clojutre.org/2017/#purescript" class="uri">clojutre.org/2017/#purescript</a>.</p>
<p>I talked about the RowList type-level structure using RowToList in PureScript and its various applications. The video and slides are available in the link, or via YouTube and Speakerdeck respectively.</p>

<p>I was a guest in March 2017 for the podcast Functional Geekery: <a href="https://www.functionalgeekery.com/episode-88-justin-woo/" class="uri">functionalgeekery.com/episode-88-justin-woo/</a>.</p>
<p>In the episode, I awkwardly talk about my background and how I got into PureScript and evangelizing it.</p>
<p>In short, I went from writing Java to writing a small amount of Clojure/Clojurescript, lots of Javascript, some Elm, and then started using PureScript afterwards. I started using Haskell after I was already using PureScript, strangely enough. I also talk about some of the things I don't like about Elm, and why I switched over to using PureScript for my compile-to-JS needs for both Node.js and browser code.</p>
