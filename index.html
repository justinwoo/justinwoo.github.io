<h2 id="welcome">Welcome</h2>
<p>I'm an American living in Helsinki, Finland. I am generally known for using PureScript, Nix, Haskell, and a bit of Rust.</p>
<p>If you would like to contact me, please use Twitter.</p>

<h2 id="blog">Blog posts</h2>
<p>I write blog posts on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/justinwoo/my-blog-posts">github.com/justinwoo/my-blog-posts</a>. These are generally about PureScript or Nix, but sometimes about Haskell and other technologies.</p>

<h2 id="egghead">Egghead.io</h2>
<p>I have done some lessons on egghead.io: <a href="https://egghead.io/instructors/justin-woo">egghead.io/instructors/justin-woo</a>. These lessons are mostly about PureScript, and there are not yet so many.</p>

<h3 id="jun-2019">18 - 21 Jun 2019</h3>
<p>I was invited to speak about PureScript at Monadic Party in Poznan, Poland: <a href="https://monadic.party/">monadic.party</a></p>
<p>I gave a workshop on "Real World PureScript", where I talked about the PureScript type system and approaches to FFI that allow for solving problems in various ways.</p>
<p>The workshop materials are available on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/justinwoo/real-world-purescript-workshop-2019">github.com/justinwoo/real-world-purescript-workshop-2019</a></p>

<h3 id="jul-2018">14 Jul 2018</h3>
<p>I was invited to speak about PureScript at the Front-End x Design Conference in Taipei, Taiwan: <a href="https://2018.fedc.tw/" class="uri">2018.fedc.tw/</a>.</p>
<p>I spoke about PureScript features that make it unique and some of the ways people might readdress ways they think about modeling problems.</p>
<p>I have recorded a video where I go over my slides from the conference: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaQo_kGY-Lc" class="uri">youtube.com/watch?v=iaQo_kGY-Lc</a></p>

<h3 id="apr-2018">4 Apr 2018</h3>
<p>I was a guest in April 2018 for the podcast CoRecursive with Adam Bell: <a href="https://corecursive.com/010-purescript-and-avocados-with-justin-woo" class="uri">corecursive.com/010-purescript-and-avocados-with-justin-woo</a>.</p>
<p>In the episode, I talk about things that are good about PureScript, some of the things I believe about writing programs, about avocadoes and kabocha, and about the importance of culture in programming language communities.</p>

<h3 id="sep-2017">1 Sep 2017</h3>
<p>I was a speaker at Small FP Conf: <a href="https://clojutre.org/2017/#purescript" class="uri">clojutre.org/2017/#purescript</a>.</p>
<p>I talked about the RowList type-level structure using RowToList in PureScript and its various applications. The video and slides are available in the link, or via YouTube and Speakerdeck respectively.</p>

<h3 id="mar-2017">28 Mar 2017</h3>
<p>I was a guest in March 2017 for the podcast Functional Geekery: <a href="https://www.functionalgeekery.com/episode-88-justin-woo/" class="uri">functionalgeekery.com/episode-88-justin-woo/</a>.</p>
<p>In the episode, I awkwardly talk about my background and how I got into PureScript and evangelizing it.</p>
<p>In short, I went from writing Java to writing a small amount of Clojure/Clojurescript, lots of Javascript, some Elm, and then started using PureScript afterwards. I started using Haskell after I was already using PureScript, strangely enough. I also talk about some of the things I don't like about Elm, and why I switched over to using PureScript for my compile-to-JS needs for both Node.js and browser code.</p>
