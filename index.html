  <h2>Welcome</h2>

  <p>I'm an American living in Helsinki, Finland and I like PureScript and Haskell.
  </p>

  <p>Please message me on Twitter sometime if you'd like to get coffee or beers. Please try not to e-mail me.
  </p>

  <p>Generally, I am available to answer questions about my libraries and about PureScript. Feel free to ping me on Twitter or FP slack.
  </p>
  <p>I am on...</p>

  <p>I speak...</p>

  <ul>
    <li>English - as a "native" speaker</li>

    <li>Japanese - just okay, I have lived in Japan and have basic conversations
    </li>
    <li>Korean - only verbally and worse than Japanese</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Spam</h2>

  <p>I would like for Helsinki to have a Code & Coffee meetup. Please contact me if you have any interest in providing space and co-hosting.
  </p>
  <p>A Code and Coffee meetup is...</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A 9/10 - 12/1PM meetup meeting every 2/3 weeks on Saturday morning.</li>

    <li>The organizers will gather people for the first ten minutes to present themselves and what they will work on that day.
    </li>
    <li>Any company representatives will advertise their job openings.</li>

    <li>The rest of the session is free form, with mostly smaller groups working on something.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>I have previously attended the
    <a href="https://www.meetup.com/NoVA-Code-Coffee/">NoVA Code & Coffee
    </a>meetup. I hope you'll consider hosting one in Helsinki or your own city.

  <h2>Small notes</h2>

  <p>Most all of my blog posts are on

    <a href="http://qiita.com/kimagure">Qiita
    </a>and are almost exclusively about PureScript and Haskell.
  </p>

  <p>In 2017, I wrote 30 blog posts, of which 27 had content about PureScript and 3 had content about Haskell. I plan to write at least 12 but less than 50 posts for 2018.
  </p>
  <h3>1 Sep 2017</h3>

  <p>I was a speaker at Small FP Conf:

    <a href="http://clojutre.org/2017/#purescript">http://clojutre.org/2017/#purescript
    </a>.
  </p>

  <p>I talked about the RowList type-level structure using RowToList in PureScript and its various applications. The video and slides are available in the link, or via YouTube and Speakerdeck respectively.
  </p>
  <h3>28 Mar 2017</h3>

  <p>I was a guest in March 2017 for the podcast Functional Geekery:

    <a href="https://www.functionalgeekery.com/episode-88-justin-woo/">https://www.functionalgeekery.com/episode-88-justin-woo/
    </a>.
  </p>

  <p>In the episode, I awkwardly talk about my background and how I got into PureScript and evangelizing it.
  </p>

  <p>In short, I went from writing Java to writing a small amount of Clojure/Clojurescript, lots of Javascript, some Elm, and then started using PureScript afterwards. I started using Haskell after I was already using PureScript, strangely enough. I also talk about some of the things I donâ€™t like about Elm, and why I switched over to using PureScript for my compile-to-JS needs for both Node.js and browser code.
  </p>
  <h3>6 Oct 2016</h3>

  <p>In October 2016, I prepared a blog post for the Futurice blog here:

    <a href="http://futurice.com/blog/making-a-weather-telegram-bot-in-purescript">http://futurice.com/blog/making-a-weather-telegram-bot-in-purescript
    </a>
  </p>

  <p>The contents are fairly out of date (even as of 7 May 2017), but hopefully still somewhat interesting to read.
