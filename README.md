## Welcome

I'm an American living in Helsinki, Finland and I like PureScript and
Haskell.

Please message me on Twitter sometime if you'd like to get coffee or
beers. Please try not to e-mail me.

Generally, I am available to answer questions about my libraries and
about PureScript. Feel free to ping me on Twitter or FP slack.

I am on...

* Twitter: @[jusrin00](https://twitter.com/jusrin00)
* Github: [justinwoo](https://github.com/justinwoo)
* Speakerdeck (talks): [justinwoo](https://speakerdeck.com/justinwoo/)
* Qiita (blog): [kimagure](http://qiita.com/kimagure)
* FP slack: [justinw](https://fpchat-invite.herokuapp.com/)

I speak...

* English - as a "native" speaker
* Japanese - just okay, I have lived in Japan and have basic conversations
* Korean - only verbally and worse than Japanese

## Spam

I would like for Helsinki to have a Code & Coffee meetup. Please contact me if you have any interest in providing space and co-hosting.

A Code and Coffee meetup is...

* A 9/10 - 12/1PM meetup meeting every 2/3 weeks on Saturday morning.
* The organizers will gather people for the first ten minutes to present themselves and what they will work on that day.
* Any company representatives will advertise their job openings.
* The rest of the session is free form, with mostly smaller groups working on something.

I have previously attended the [NoVA Code & Coffee](https://www.meetup.com/NoVA-Code-Coffee/) meetup. I hope you'll consider hosting one in Helsinki or your own city.

## Small notes

I have a [repository](https://github.com/justinwoo/my-blog-posts) of my blog posts, which are mostly posted on [Qiita](http://qiita.com/kimagure) and are almost exclusively about PureScript and Haskell.

### 14 Jul 2018

I was invited to speak about PureScript at the Front-End x Design Conference in Taipei, Taiwan: <http://2018.fedc.tw/>. I spoke about PureScript features that make it unique and some of the ways people might readdress ways they think about modeling problems.

I have recorded a video where I go over my slides from the conference: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaQo_kGY-Lc>

### 4 Apr 2018

I was a guest in April 2018 for the podcast CoRecursive with Adam Bell: <https://corecursive.com/010-purescript-and-avocados-with-justin-woo>.

In the episode, I talk about things that are good about PureScript, some of the things I believe about writing programs, about avocadoes and kabocha, and about the importance of culture in programming language communities.

### 1 Sep 2017

I was a speaker at Small FP Conf:
<http://clojutre.org/2017/#purescript>.

I talked about the RowList type-level structure using RowToList in PureScript and its various applications. The video and slides are available in the link, or via YouTube and Speakerdeck respectively.

### 28 Mar 2017

I was a guest in March 2017 for the podcast Functional Geekery: <https://www.functionalgeekery.com/episode-88-justin-woo/>.

In the episode, I awkwardly talk about my background and how I got into PureScript and evangelizing it.

In short, I went from writing Java to writing a small amount of Clojure/Clojurescript, lots of Javascript, some Elm, and then started using PureScript afterwards. I started using Haskell after I was already using PureScript, strangely enough. I also talk about some of the things I don't like about Elm, and why I switched over to using PureScript for my compile-to-JS needs for both Node.js and browser code.

### 6 Oct 2016

In October 2016, I prepared a blog post for the Futurice blog here: <http://futurice.com/blog/making-a-weather-telegram-bot-in-purescript>

The contents are fairly out of date (even as of 7 May 2017), but hopefully still somewhat interesting to read.
