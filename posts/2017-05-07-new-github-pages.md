title: New Github Pages
---

My Github pages has been dead for a looong time with no new information or anything. This is an attempt to put a new placeholder that then links to content in other pages.

I will also try to add posts to this page for anything that is not on Qiita (my normal blog) or Speakerdeck (where I have my slides). I'll try to add some ramblings to the posts that acutally get posted that *might* provide better context.
