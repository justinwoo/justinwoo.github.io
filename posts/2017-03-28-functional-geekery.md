title: Guest on Functional Geekery
---

I was a guest in March 2017 for the podcast Functional Geekery: [https://www.functionalgeekery.com/episode-88-justin-woo/](https://www.functionalgeekery.com/episode-88-justin-woo/).

In the episode, I awkwardly talk about my background and how I got into Purescript and evangelizing it.

In short, I went from writing Java to writing a small amount of Clojure/Clojurescript, lots of Javascript, some Elm, and then started using Purescript afterwards. I started using Haskell after I was already using Purescript, strangely enough. I also talk about some of the things I don't like about Elm, and why I switched over to using Purescript for my compile-to-JS needs for both Node.js and browser code.

For other perspectives on the whole "why not Elm" topic, you might consider:

* Claudia's "Building a Graphical IDE in Elm/Purescript" slides from ElixirConf 2017 [http://doppioslash.com/slides/ElixirConf2017.pdf](http://doppioslash.com/slides/ElixirConf2017.pdf) [https://twitter.com/doppioslash/status/860830006389374978](https://twitter.com/doppioslash/status/860830006389374978)
* Isaac's "Selecting a platform: JavaScript vs Elm vs PureScript vs GHCjs vs Scalajs" [http://mutanatum.com/posts/2017-01-12-Browser-FP-Head-to-Head.html](http://mutanatum.com/posts/2017-01-12-Browser-FP-Head-to-Head.html) [https://twitter.com/fresheyeball/status/821652744188608512](https://twitter.com/fresheyeball/status/821652744188608512)

But really, you should use at least *something* other than raw JS.
